## Case study

In this folder, we explore the viability of various interventions
on the behaviour of Myc-deregulated breast cancer tumours. Specifically:

 - `single-perturbation.ipynb` shows how to compute trap spaces for 
 different druggable knock-outs (full results available in 
 `single-perturbation.tsv`, highlights in `apoptosis-table.tsv` and
 `proliferation-table.tsv`).
 - `dual-perturbation.ipynb` explores dual-variable knock-outs and how
 to assess such knockou-outs based on their "best case" and "worst case"
 outcomes (full results in `dual-perturbation.tsv`, summary in 
 `sorted-dual-perturbation.tsv`).
